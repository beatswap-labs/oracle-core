# oracle-core

`oracle-core` is the core backend system of the oracle infrastructure that powers **BeatSwap.io** and its partner ecosystem. It provides secure and scalable APIs for price data, token distribution, transaction handling, and on-chain/off-chain integration.

This service acts as the hub for coordinating data flow between the BeatSwap frontend, partner services, and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) canisters.
